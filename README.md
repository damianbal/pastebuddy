# PasteBuddy
> Simple code sharing

Simple website for sharing code, made with Vue.js and [Shipla](https://github.com/damianbal/shipla) for back-end. 

## Installation

Of course you would need node (npm) installed and Vue.js CLI tools

```sh
npm run build # for building
npm run serve # serve locally
```
